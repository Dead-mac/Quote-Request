  {
    q: 'Why do you need my property address?',
    a: 'The location of your property is a primary factor in determining your premium. It helps us assess risks related to neighbourhood, proximity to fire stations, and local weather patterns.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I don\'t know the exact year my roof was replaced?',
    a: 'An approximation is perfectly fine. The age and material of your roof are important for calculating potential risks from weather, so your best estimate helps us create a more accurate quote.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a security system actually lower my premium?',
    a: 'Yes, in most cases! A monitored security system can significantly reduce the risk of theft and damage, which often translates into a discount on your home insurance.',

export const AUTO_FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Why do you need all household drivers?',
    a: 'Insurers need to know about all licensed drivers in the household who may have access to the vehicle, as this affects the overall risk profile of the policy.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What counts as "continuous insurance"?',
    a: 'This refers to the number of years you have maintained auto insurance without any gaps in coverage (e.g., a period of more than 30 days without insurance). A longer history of continuous coverage can lead to significant discounts.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to list minor parking tickets?',
    a: 'Generally, you only need to disclose moving violations (like speeding tickets) or more serious infractions. Minor, non-moving violations like parking tickets typically do not affect your insurance rates.',
